## 💡 Motivation

I didn't want another todo-app portfolio. Instead, I asked myself: *How would I build a real-world feature with persistence, async workflows, and external API integration cleanly in Blazor?*

ArcFlow is my answer — a project where I make deliberate architectural decisions, document them, and demonstrate them through concrete features. The focus is not on feature quantity, but on **depth and quality** of implementation.

## 🔭 Scope of this Project

ArcFlow is a **portfolio showcase**, not a production tool. The project grows organically — new features are only added when they are architecturally interesting and bring real complexity.

### 🎵 YouTube Playlist Manager (Architecture Demonstrator)

The main feature deliberately combines several challenges in one:

- **Playlist Management** — Create and organize custom playlists
- **Integrated Player** — YouTube IFrame API via controlled JS interop
- **Drag & Drop** — SortableJS with deliberate lifecycle handling in Blazor
- **Persistence** — Local storage via SQLite (EF Core)
- **Explicit State Management** — Store-driven data flow through Actions, Reducers, and Effects
- **Error Handling & Notifications** — Result pattern with categorized errors, MudBlazor Snackbar notifications, and structured logging
- **Undo/Redo** — Snapshot-based time travel for queue actions with Past/Future stacks
- **Shuffle & Repeat** — Permutation-based shuffle with playback history stack, three repeat modes (Off/All/One), pure strategy functions for navigation

> More tools will follow when they bring something architecturally new to the table.

## 🧠 Architecture — TL;DR

The project uses a **strict store architecture** with unidirectional data flow:

```
UI → Action → Reducer → State → UI
                ↓
            Effects (DB, JS Interop)
```

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Single Source of Truth** | All feature state lives in the store |
| **Pure Reducers** | No DB access, no JS, no async logic |
| **Side-Effect Isolation** | DB and JS interop exclusively in Effects |
| **UI is dispatch-only** | Components read state and dispatch actions — no direct manipulation |

This architecture is deliberately stricter than necessary for a project of this size. The goal is to demonstrate that I don't just know these principles — I apply them consistently.

## 🎯 Why this matters

This project shows how I approach software development:

- **Make architectural decisions deliberately** instead of copy-pasting from tutorials
- **Take state management seriously** — even when Blazor doesn't "need" Redux
- **Use JS interop in a controlled way** — no hidden state between C# and JavaScript
- **Document code** — not just what, but why

> In short: The feature isn't the showcase — the way it's built is.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

> No deadlines, no promises — just the direction this project is heading.

**Current Focus**
- Polish UI — responsiveness, edge cases, micro-interactions

**Next**
- Playback persistence — restore player state (position, active track) across sessions

**Completed**
- ~~Shuffle & Repeat~~ — Permutation-based shuffle (Fisher-Yates, deterministic seed), three repeat modes (Off/All/One), playback history stack for Previous in shuffle mode, pure strategy functions (`PlaybackNavigation`), `RepairPlaybackStructures` for queue mutation resilience, undo-history passthrough via `IsPlaybackTransient`
- ~~MudBlazor layout migration~~ — Full migration to MudLayout (MudAppBar, MudDrawer Mini variant, MudNavMenu), replaced NotificationPanel with MudBlazor ISnackbar
- ~~Undo/Redo~~ — Snapshot-based time travel for queue actions (SelectVideo, SortChanged) with Past/Future stacks, UndoPolicy, and effect gating
- ~~Persistence~~ — SQLite with EF Core, domain models with Fluent API mappings
- ~~Playlist & video management~~ — CRUD operations, selection, queue control
- ~~YouTube Player integration~~ — IFrame API via controlled JS interop, PlayerState tracking
- ~~Drag & drop~~ — SortableJS with deliberate lifecycle handling outside of Blazor diffing
- ~~UI foundation~~ — MudBlazor integration, layout with sidebar, drawers as dispatch-only components
- ~~Store architecture~~ — Unidirectional data flow with actions, reducer and effects, channel-based action queue
- ~~Immutability & lifecycle~~ — Immutable records, ImmutableList collections, clean dispose pattern
- ~~Error handling strategy~~ — Result pattern, categorized errors, toast notifications, structured logging

**On the Radar**
- Cross-feature communication — event bus or shared state between future feature modules
